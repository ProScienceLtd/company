Notifiable Animal Diseases in the UK: Vigilance, Reporting, and Control


In the dynamic landscape of agriculture, the United Kingdom places a strong emphasis on monitoring and controlling notifiable animal diseases. These diseases, which can have serious implications for both animal and human health, are subject to stringent reporting and control measures. Understanding the list of notifiable diseases, how to report suspected cases, and the establishment of surveillance and control zones is crucial for maintaining the health and well-being of the UK's diverse animal population.

What is a notifiable disease?

The technical answer is a disease named in Section 88 of the Animal Health Act 1981 *or* an Order made under the Animal Health Act.

The UK government maintains a comprehensive list of notifiable animal diseases, which includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. The list encompasses a wide range of species and covers various diseases including diseases such as foot and mouth disease, avian influenza and bovine tuberculosis. Most of these diseases are exotic (not present in this country, for example: foot and mouth disease) but some are endemic (present in the country) and considered significant enough to include as notifiable due to their associated economic and welfare burden (for example: bovine tuberculosis).

Several notifiable diseases are spread by biting insects, ticks and mites.

We will be holding small group meetings during outbreaks of such diseases to connect communities to experts and the latest research. 

Notifiable diseases spread by biting insects include:

-	African Horse Sickness
-	African swine fever
-	Bluetongue virus
-	Epizootic Haemorrhagic Virus Disease
-	Equine Viral Encephalomyelitis
-	Equine infectious anaemia
-	Lumpy skin
-	Rift Valley Fever
-	Sheep scab (mites)
-	Swine Vesicular Disease
-	Vesicular Stomatitis
-	West Nile virus

Several other notifiable diseases may be spread mechanically by biting insects, ticks and/or mites in addition to the main transmission routes. 

Reporting Suspected Cases:

If a farmer, veterinarian, or any individual suspects the presence of a notifiable disease, it is imperative to report it promptly. The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) provide [guidance] [guidance] on how to report suspected cases. This often involves contacting the local APHA office or the 24/7 Animal Disease Reporting Hotline.

Surveillance and Control Zones:

In the event of a suspected or confirmed outbreak of a notifiable disease, authorities may establish control zones comprising of protection zones (usually 3km around the affected premise) and surveillance zones (usually 10km around the premise) to contain the spread. The rules within these zones may be complex, risk-based and gradually relaxed as the disease eradication process is applied. These zones help facilitate targeted monitoring, control measures, and communication with stakeholders. The establishment of these zones is a critical step in minimizing the impact of the disease on both animal health and the economy.

In these zones, movement restrictions may be enforced, and enhanced biosecurity measures are implemented to prevent the further spread of the disease. Surveillance efforts are intensified, with increased testing and monitoring to identify and manage infected or at-risk animals.

More information about specific diseases can be found on Defra, APHA and veterinary websites.
