## Hi there

If youâ€™ve landed on this post, chances are youâ€™ve **spotted one of our WaSpookers out in the wild**.  

First of all; **nice observational skills**. Youâ€™re clearly paying attention, and we love that.

So... **what is a WaSpooker?**

Glad you asked!

### The Quick Buzz:

The **WaSpooker** is a **non-toxic, environmentally friendly wasp management tool**.

Instead of trapping or killing wasps (which is a bit grim, honestly), the WaSpooker **encourages them to move along**.  
How?! By making them believe the space is already occupied by another colony.

Itâ€™s like hanging a "taken" sign on your garden.  
Cool, right?

### Why We're Doing This

Most wasp products:  
- Attract wasps into your space ðŸ˜¬  
- Trap and kill them in sticky messes ðŸ˜–  
- Look... pretty awful ðŸ¤¢  

WaSpooker does the opposite:  
- **Pushes them away**  
- No chemicals, no glue  
- No drama

Weâ€™re currently testing WaSpooker with help from our **brilliant academic partners**.  
Early results are super promising, and weâ€™re buzzing (sorry) about whatâ€™s coming next.
