Mosquitoes and *Culicoides* biting midges are frequently misidentified in the media, with pictures of crane flies, winter gnats and fungus gnats (all none biting species!) regularly being incorrectly used. 

This wrong identification isnâ€™t just embarrassing for the publication or company involved, but also has several negative consequences. Firstly, it perpetuates a culture of fear and misunderstanding around these insects. This can lead to a lack of appreciation and understanding of the important role that mosquitoes and midges play in our ecosystems. Only the females of both species bite, with males acting as important pollinators. We are currently supporting exciting new research investigating exactly how important these species are as pollinators in the UK.

Secondly, the misidentification of mosquitoes and midges can lead to ineffective pest control measures. This can lead to confusion about what they are looking for, and incorrect assumptions about the characteristics and behaviour of mosquitoes and midges. This may result in people using inappropriate methods to control them, such as using broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm other beneficial insects or the use of ineffective traps, increasing frustration and unnecessary costs to the user.

Lastly, the misidentification of mosquitoes can hinder scientific research and public health efforts. If people are misinformed about the characteristics and behaviour of mosquitoes and midges, they may be less likely to take preventative measures to avoid bites or support research into vector-borne diseases.

In addition to these concerns when midges and mosquitoes are misidentified in public platforms, we have also noticed incorrect identification in information within the expert domain. This is particularly concerning, with incorrect identifications (such as pictures of male mosquitoes and winter gnats displayed as female mosquitoes and non-biting flies as midges) in pest control and farming media. 

We can help! If you are putting together a leaflet or blog about mosquitoes, midges or other vector species, get in touch. We can double-check the pictures accurately reflect your text preventing misinformation and embarrassment.
