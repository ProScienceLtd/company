Sweet itch, also known as summer eczema, is a common skin condition in horses that can cause significant discomfort and even lead to secondary infections. 

Sweet itch is caused by an allergic reaction to the saliva of certain biting insects. Culicoides midges are the most common culprits, but other biting insects such as mosquitoes and blackflies can also cause the condition. Horses that are sensitive to the saliva of these insects will develop an allergic reaction, which can cause severe itching and discomfort.

The symptoms of sweet itch can vary from horse to horse, but typically include:

Itching and scratching: Horses with sweet itch will often rub or scratch their skin excessively, especially around the mane, tail, and belly.

Hair loss: Over time, the constant scratching and rubbing can lead to hair loss and skin damage.

Crusty scabs: As the condition progresses, the horse's skin may become covered in crusty scabs.

Secondary infections: In severe cases, the constant scratching and skin damage can lead to secondary infections, which can cause further discomfort and require veterinary treatment.

If you suspect your horse is suffering from sweet itch, get in touch with your veterinarian. If confirmed one of the best things you can do is prevent your horse from being bitten. This includes the use of fly rugs/masks, repellents and housing your horse during peak midge activity (one hour either side of dusk and dawn).
