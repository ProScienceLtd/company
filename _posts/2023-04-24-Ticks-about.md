The [tick] [tick] season has officially started for this year, with the classic long trousers tucked into socks look back in fashion for our field staff (has it ever been out of style?).

Numbers are really increasing for both our targeted drags and our less targeted ‘I was outside setting up midge traps/ monitoring our weather stations/ walking Barney (dog) and look at all these ticks I found’ collections. Unsurprisingly *Ixodes ricinus* represents the majority species in non-targeted collections.

Here at ProScience Ltd we can provide you with live or preserved field caught ticks for your projects. We work closely with expert scientists and productive sites across the UK to be able to provide field caught ticks almost all year round. We can deliver laboratory testing of acaracides and repellents, or support offsite testing through our expertise. Our tick specialists can provide invaluable insights and tips to working with these parasites, including supporting colony establishment and maintenance.
