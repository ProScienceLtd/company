# Collecting *Culicoides* biting midges

*Culicoides* biting midges are tiny biting flies (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) only 1-3mm in length. There are around 50 species in the UK, which can be identified through the patterns on their wings. Several species are known pests, as either as biting nuisance (think the Scottish midge: *Culicoides impunctatus*) or through the potential to spread diseases such as Schmallenberg virus and bluetongue virus (certain species within the Obsoletus and Pulicaris groups).

Midges are so small they are not able to fly when it is windy and dry out really quickly when it is hot. When the air is still, humid and there are other animals around you are likely to find midges.

Female midges have to consume a blood meal to have the protein needed to produce eggs. Some species can lay their first egg batch without this first blood meal, as is the case with the Scottish midge, which is why you can find so many of them. These swarms don’t just put off tourists, but are responsible for forestry workers being unable to work for as much as 20% of the summer in Scotland, a huge cost to an industry worth around £954 million to the Scottish economy.

Different species of *Culicoides* like feeding on different animals. This means different species of midges are important for the spread of different diseases: [bluetongue virus] [bluetongue virus], [Schmallenberg virus] [Schmallenberg virus], avian malaria, [epizootic haemorrhagic disease] [epizootic haemorrhagic disease] and many more. Midges may also be involved in the spread of African swine fever and lumpy skin disease, although this is not currently certain.
