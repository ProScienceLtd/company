This June has been a hot one and with this hot weather came horseflies in abundance.

Visits to the NHS website’s insect bites and stings [page][page] has tripled this summer, with over 261,364 visits in June alone!

This seems likely down to [horsefly][horsefly] activity – we have caught record numbers at all our sites, with more clegs (*Haematopota pluvialis*) and dark giant horseflies (*Tabanus sudeticus*) than previous whole years combined.
