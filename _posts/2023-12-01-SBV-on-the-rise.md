We have heard several reports of suspected Schmallenberg virus on farm again this year. Farmers and vets have been reporting confirmed cases and high losses of around 10% in both Hereford and Hertfordshire both this and last December.

[Schmallenberg virus] [Schmallenberg virus] is considered endemic, and it is likely we will continue to see waves of disease every few years when immunity in the national herd drops. Currently, there is no information being collected on Schmallenberg virus, which makes it hard to predict the cost of the disease, and subsequently hard to research. Previous studies have demonstrated high individual [costs of Schmallenberg virus] [costs of Schmallenberg virus] and, due to low demand, there is no longer a vaccine on the market.

Sadly this leaves little to be done in the face of increased schmallenberg cases and livestock owners, particularly those of sheep, should prepare for a potential increase in barren rates, lower scanning percentages and an increase in deformed calves and lambs born this year.

Vets can still have bloods sent for screening for Schmallenberg virus if it is suspected.
