Keds are a type of biting louse that can affect both humans and animals, including horses, cattle, and sheep in the UK. While they are not known to transmit diseases, they can cause discomfort and skin irritation.

Keds are wingless insects that live in the hair or wool of their hosts, feeding on their blood. They are most active in the winter months, and can cause itching, scabbing, and hair loss in infested animals.

Treatment for keds usually involves topical insecticides, such as sprays and powders, that are applied directly to the infested areas. Regular grooming and cleaning of animal bedding and housing can also help prevent keds from becoming a problem.

If you suspect that your animals may be infested with keds, it is important to seek veterinary advice as soon as possible to determine the best course of treatment. With proper care and management, keds can be effectively controlled, and your animals can remain healthy and comfortable.
