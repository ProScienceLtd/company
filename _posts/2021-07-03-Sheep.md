Schmallenberg virus is transmitted by *Culicoides* biting midges. First described in 2011 Schmallenberg virus rapidly spread throughout Europe and to the UK. Several species of *Culicoides* have been demonstrated competent for disease transmission- including the farm associated Obsoletus group *Culicoides*.

Sheep are particularly susceptible to Schmallenberg virus, as although adult animals rarely display clinical signs of disease, infection during the vulnerable stages of gestation can result in huge losses through abortion, fetal malformations and losses of pregnant sheep through the difficult labour of malformed lambs. This is obviously distressing to farmers and lambing staff as well as financially draining.
