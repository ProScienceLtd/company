Does your farm or smallholding have a biosecurity protocol?

Ensuring good biosecurity practices is crucial for maintaining the health and well-being of your animals and preventing the spread of diseases. There are [great guides] [great guides]  online and your vet can help tailor the advice for your site.

Here are a few ideas to consider:


Establish Biosecurity Zones:
Divide your farm into different biosecurity zones based on the risk of disease transmission. Create zones for animals, equipment, and personnel. Allow for cleaning points between these areas. This helps prevent cross-contamination between different areas of the farm. Where possible restrict access to your farm by establishing controlled entry points. Limit the number of people entering the premises, and ensure that visitors follow biosecurity protocols, such as wearing clean and appropriate clothing and footwear.

Quarantine New Animals:
Whenever new animals are introduced to your site, isolate them in a designated quarantine area for a specific period that your vet can help advise you on (depending on livestock species, animal location/movement and diseases of concern). This allows you to monitor their health and prevent the potential introduction of infectious diseases to your existing livestock.

Practice Good Hygiene:
Maintain high standards of cleanliness by regularly cleaning and disinfecting equipment, facilities, and vehicles. Provide handwashing, boot washing and sanitation facilities for everyone entering or leaving the farm. Consider vehicle wheel disinfection stations at farm entry points. This helps to reduce the risk of disease transmission through contaminated surfaces.

Monitor Animal Health:
Implement a regular monitoring program for the health of your animals. Be vigilant for signs of illness, and promptly isolate and treat any sick animals. Regular veterinary check-ups and vaccinations can also play a crucial role in preventing the spread of diseases. Note any [notifiable diseases] [notifiable diseases] circulating as these need to be immediately reported

Manage Manure and Waste Properly:
Implement effective manure management practices to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Proper disposal and treatment of waste materials, including manure, can help prevent the contamination of the environment.

Control Pests and Vectors:
Implement measures to control pests and vectors that may carry and transmit diseases. This includes strategies such as insect control, rodent management, and bird exclusion to minimize the risk of disease introduction.

Educate and Train Personnel:
Ensure that everyone working on the farm is educated about biosecurity practices and understands their role in maintaining a secure environment. Regular training sessions can reinforce the importance of following biosecurity protocols.

Maintain Records:
Keep detailed records of animal movements, health status, and any biosecurity measures implemented. This information can be invaluable in case of disease outbreaks and helps to track the history of animal health on your farm. 

Stay Informed:
Stay updated on the latest developments in animal health and biosecurity practices. Engage with veterinary professionals, extension services, and industry experts to enhance your knowledge and adapt your biosecurity measures based on emerging threats. During outbreaks of vector borne diseases we will be organising local meetings with experts to answer questions â€“ contact us if you would like to be kept informed of such events.

Biosecurity is an ongoing process, and adapting your practices based on the specific needs of your farm and the current health landscape is essential. Regular assessments and adjustments to your biosecurity plan will contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of your farm.
