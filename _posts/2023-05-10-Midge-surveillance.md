We regularly monitor for *Culicoides* biting midges from the beginning of April, expecting an increase in activity in May as the weather improves. 

Here at ProScience Ltd we can meet your midge needs. May it be ongoing surveillance, preserved specimens or field testing traps and repellents.

If you have any questions, or would like a quote, please get in touch with us today!
