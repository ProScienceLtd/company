West Nile Virus is spread by mosquitoes and infects birds, humans and horses. Infection can be mild, however in some cases it can result in encephalitis, meningitis and death. Currently we do not have West Nile Virus in the UK, however we do have species of mosquito that are capable of transmitting the disease.

Horses that are infected with West Nile Virus typically do not show any clinical signs of disease, however those that do may show signs of fever, sleepiness, dullness, stumbling/limb weakness, facial paralysis, seizures and/or an inability to rise. These signs may appear suddenly or gradually develop and worsen. In clinical cases of unvaccinated horses as many as 1 in 3 may die from the disease. West Nile Virus is a notifiable disease in horses in the UK and if suspected must be immediately reported to the Defra Rural Services Helpline â€“ your vet will do this if they are concerned.

We undertake monitoring of mosquito species across the country and provide many mosquito services from [trapping][trapping] to [identification][identification].
