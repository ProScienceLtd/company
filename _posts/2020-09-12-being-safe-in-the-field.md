Working at field sites presents multiple risks that need to be mitigated, both in terms of personal safety and biosecurity.

Hazards to personal health include risks associated with lone work, working alongside livestock, machinery and in new environments. Identifying and mitigating risks is crucial to all fieldwork undertaken at any stage of a researchers career and is something we take extremely seriously at ProScience.

Travelling between field sites increases potential risks associated with disease transfer. With correct biosecurity procedures in place (i.e. decontamination of vehicles, PPE, equipment and personnel) associated risks can be reduced. 

We always work with our partner sites to understand their site procedures, protocols, specific risks and concerns whilst maintaining the highest level of biosecurity is practised when we are visiting premises.
