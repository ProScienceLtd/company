Epizootic haemorrhagic disease is circulating for the first time in southern Europe. There has never previously been a case of epizootic haemorrhagic disease in the UK.

Epizootic haemorrhagic disease is a notifiable disease that can infect ruminants (deer, cattle, sheep and goats). It is a virus in the same family and genus as bluetongue virus (*Reoviridae: Orbivirus*), and like [bluetongue] [bluetongue] is spread by *Culicoides* biting midges. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease outbreaks occur sporadically globally, causing significant economic losses and posing challenges to wildlife management.

Similarly to bluetongue virus, there are several serotypes of epizootic haemorrhagic disease, causing varying levels of disease across ruminant species.

The current serotype circulating in Europe is serotype 8 (EHDV-8) for which there is no vaccine.

The only signs of disease can be lower productivity rates due to weight loss and lameness, with clinical signs of disease typically only observed in severe infections. 

The main signs are:
-	fever
-	weakness
-	lack of appetite
-	more saliva than usual
-	difficulty swallowing
-	skin rash on the udder
-	bleeding (skin and internal tissues)
-	swollen red skin near hooves	
-   swollen lining of the mouth
-	mouth ulcers
-	difficulty breathing
-	sudden death (particularly in deer)

Wild ruminants such as deer may also:
-	have a swollen face
-	have redness of the eyes and mouth
-	have excessive bleeding (in diarrhoea and urine)
-	be dehydrated

In some cases there are no obvious clinical signs that an animal is infected.

Research into the *Culicoides* acting as the European vectors of epizootic haemorrhagic disease is ongoing and will affect the likelihood of more northerly transmission. We will be monitoring the situation and will hold local meetings with experts to allow community groups to ask questions if the disease continues to expand northwards in Europe.
